# Bridge Edge Detection using Sobel Filter

This project applies a Sobel filter to highlight edges in a bridge image using OpenCV. Sobel filtering is a classic technique in image processing for detecting gradients and edges in both horizontal and vertical directions.

## 📷 Input

- A grayscale or color image of a bridge (`bridge.jpg` or similar)

## 🧪 Output

- An edge-highlighted image using the Sobel filter
- Optionally, separate horizontal and vertical edge maps

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended)
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
